# Employement data project
A project looking at various employees from a company based in different locations around the world.
Cleaned the data and then analysed and wrote a report identifying the trends in salaries and bonuses.
Jupyter Notebook was used to clean the data and Power BI was used to analyse.
The Power BI file was not used for presenting, merely in the use of analysis.
